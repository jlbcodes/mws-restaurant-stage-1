## About
The Restaurant Reviews project from Udacity's Nanodegree program **Front-end Web Development**. The Restaurant Reviews App contains a map of Restaurants in a neighborhood along with their contact details, hours, and reviews.

The application is expected to be have a responsive design, meet accessibility standards, and have offline availability. Accessibility was achieved through ARIA labels. For offline availability, the site uses a service worker to cache responses to requests for site assets. Therefore, visited pages are rendered when there is no network access.

## Run App
1. Download or clone this repository.

2. You will need to run a simple Python server to run the application. Navigate to the root directory and start a Python server to serve up the files locally.

* First check your Python version by entering `python -V`- if you don't have Python installed, visit the [Python page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and follow the instructions.
* If you have Python 2.x, spin up a server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`
* If you have Python 3.x, spin up a server with `python3 -m http.server 8000`

3. Once your server is running, visit `http://localhost:8000`
